In most cases, the licenses don't allow you to use the work for any
commercial purpose.

## List of files

* `logo.svg`: The official logo of `TheSLinux`. This logo is using the
  font `Black Chancery` by `Doug Miles`. The font can be used freely
  for commercial purpose and it can be downloaded from
  http://www.1001fonts.com/blackchancery-font.html .
  _(If you think this font may cause any problem with our license system,
  feel free to let us now and/or dicuss on `TheSLinux` lists.)_

* `tsl.svg`: A `short` version of our logo, that contains the main
  characters (`T`, `S`, `L`). The first version only contains `T` and `S`.
  We use the secondary color from the `scheme0`
